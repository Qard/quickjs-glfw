# quickjs-glfw

NOTE: This is _EXPERIMENTAL_. As such, expect missing/broken features.

GLFW bindings for QuickJS. Meant to be built as a static library and imported
with `qjs`.

If you can get it to work with `qjsc -M glfw.so ...` also, PRs are welcome. ðŸ™‚

## Build

```sh
make
```

## Usage

```js
import {
  poll,
  Window,

  // Constants
  CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR,
  CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR,
  OPENGL_PROFILE,
  OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE,
  OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT,
  RESIZABLE,
  SAMPLES,
} from 'glfw.so'

Window.hint(CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3)
Window.hint(CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 2)
Window.hint(OPENGL_PROFILE, OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE)
Window.hint(OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, true)
Window.hint(RESIZABLE, false)
Window.hint(SAMPLES, 4)

const window = new Window(800, 600, "OpenGL")
window.makeContextCurrent()

const { width, height } = window.size
const { x, y } = window.position

console.log(`width: ${width}, height: ${height}, x: ${x}, y: ${y}`)

while (!window.shouldClose) {
  window.swapBuffers()
  poll()
}
```
